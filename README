IvyDAV is a WebDAV-based resolver for Apache Ivy that supports retrieve/publish of modular
artifacts. 

Example configuration (ivysettings):

<ivysettings>
  <settings defaultResolver="module-repository"/>

  <typedef name="webdav" classname="org.angrycamel.ivydav.IvyResolver"/>
	
  <resolvers> 
    <webdav name="module-repository" root="webdav://myhost.mydomain:8080/ivy" >
      <ivy pattern="[organisation]/[module]/ivy-[revision].xml" />
      <artifact pattern="[organisation]/[module]/[revision]/[artifact].[ext]" />
    </webdav>
  </resolvers>

</ivysettings>	

IvyDAV has been tested with Apache 2.2 using mod_dav
